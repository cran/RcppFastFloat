Description: Converting ascii text into (floating-point) numeric values is a
 very common problem. The 'fast_float' header-only C++ library by Daniel Lemire
 does it very well and very fast at up to or over to 1 gigabyte per second as
 described in more detail in <arXiv:2101.11408>. 'fast_float' is licensed under
 the Apache 2.0 license and provided here for use by other R packages via a simple
